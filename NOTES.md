# DE9 Sockets

The joystick sockets should be plastic, not metal.

TE 5747467, comes in -1 (flash), -2 (more gold), and -4 (lots of gold?). Quite pricey. Has different footprint to 'standard' DE9 - pins are set back from mounting pins. Will need custom footprint.

I got some of the 5747467 parts (the -1, -2, -4 etc indicate the quality of the gold plating). Sadly, they don't have any boardlocks, so the user will need to attach them to the PCB with M3 (or 4-40?) machine screws and nuts. Not ideal!

Are there any other black plastic DE9 male sockets? Try Harting, Kycon, Amphenol, etc.

A surplus store in Nebraska has some super cheap - 65 cents each!

# Dual PS/2 Header

Bought some from Alibaba. Found a PDF online from Kycon. I think I also found a second vendor and the diagrams matched to within 0.1mm.

I also bought the Kycon one from Mouser and it looks good (although black/black not purple/green).

# Case

I'm using a Hammond 1598C, with Parallel Port and Serial Port on ribbons.

I bought one NOS, and the screws were rusty. I bought a new one from Mouser in Beige and the finish on the parts where they meet in the middle wasn't great.

# TODO List

Need to do a front panel.
Maybe swap the DB25 and DE9 headers for boxed ones, so you can't plug them in the wrong way around?
