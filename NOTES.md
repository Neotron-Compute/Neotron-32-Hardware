# DE9 Sockets

The joystick sockets should be plastic, not metal.

TE 5747467, comes in -1 (flash), -2 (more gold), and -4 (lots of gold?). Quite pricey. Has different footprint to 'standard' DE9 - pins are set back from mounting pins. Will need custom footprint.

Are there any other black plastic DE9 male sockets? Try Harting, Kycon, Amphenol, etc.

Bought some from Alibaba. Found a PDF online from Kycon. I think I also found a second vendor and the diagrams matched to within 0.1mm.
